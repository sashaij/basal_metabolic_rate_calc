Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator

BMR Definition: Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories you burn as your body performs basic (basal) life-sustaining function. Commonly also termed as Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), which is the calories burned if you stayed in bed all day.  In either case, many utilize the basal metabolic rate formula to calculate their body’s metabolism rate.

Your BMR defines your basal metabolism rate which makes up about 60-70% of the calories we use (“burn” or expend). This includes the energy your body uses to maintain the basic function of your living and breathing body, including:

The beating of our heart
Cell production
Respiration
The maintenance of body temperature
Circulation
Nutrient processing
Your unique metabolism rate, or BMR, is influenced by a number of factors including age, weight, height, gender, environmental temperature, dieting, and exercise habits.
